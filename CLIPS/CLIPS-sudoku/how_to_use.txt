1) Load the core program files.

   (load "sudoku.clp")
   (load "solve.clp")
   
2) Load one of the output files: output-frills.clp, output-simple.clp,
   or output-none.clp. All three contain the same number of rules with
   identical LHS patterns and RHS assertion/retractions. The key 
   difference between the files is how they display output. The frills
   version displays the output as a grid of values. The simple version
   displays each row/column/value triplet on a single line. The none
   version displays no output at all.
   
   (load "output-none.clp")
   
3) Load one of the puzzle files. The puzzle file names signify both the
   size of the puzzle grid and the difficulty of the rules required to
   solve the puzzle. In general, the larger the grid size, the longer
   it takes for the solution to be found. The rule complexity ranges
   from p1, the simplest, to p18, the most complex. A complex rule is
   only attempted after the program has determined that simpler rules
   are insufficient to solve the puzzle. In general, the more complex
   the rules required, the longer it takes for the solution to be found.

   (load "puzzles//grid3x3-p17.clp")
   
4) If desired, assert the stress-test fact. The default program 
   behavior only considers complex rules when simpler rules have failed
   to find a solution. This allows the simpler rules to eliminate many
   choices before the complex rules are considered, greatly reducing the
   number of partial matches created which improves program performance.
   If the stress-test fact is asserted, the complex rules will be
   considered simultaneously with simpler rules. Running the stress test
   with a grid larger than 3x3 is not recommended due to the excessive
   time/memory requirements.

   (assert (stress-test))
   
5) Reset and run the program.
