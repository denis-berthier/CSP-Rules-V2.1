I'll consider only two sources of Futoshiki puzzles:

- Tatham. The "recursive" ones generally require T&E (except the example I have chosen). The good level is Extreme.
- ATK, most of them from level "Hard". I include a very exceptional example that requires g-braids[7].

In both sets, you'll find examples with various kinds of Subsets. 

The original sources have a much larger diversity of puzzles. Check them for yourself:
