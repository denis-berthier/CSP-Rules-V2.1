There are few websites with Hidato puzzles (maybe for IP reasons).

The original source of Hidato puzzles is the Smithsoniam magazine. Unfortunately, these puzzles are extremely easy, even the most starred ones. That's why, I'll give only few examples of them.

Mebane has a more interesting pack of puzzles. I include a few ones, showing a much larger diversity of difficulty levels.
