The best Kakuro puzzles I've found are on the ATK website: http://www.atksolutions.com/games/kakuro.html
They have three levels: easy, medius, hard. The presentation is very clear.
Here, I'll give only hard examples.
Compared to other CSP-Rules applications, KakuRules is very fast, even on large (14x14) puzzles.



Check the Kakuro-online website for relatively easy puzzles: http://www.kakuro-online.com/generator.php


You can also try the Mepham puzzles, but the graphics are hard to read  (if you still have Flash working on your computer).
