The only source I'm aware of for Map Colouring problems (considered as puzzles) is Tatham: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/map.html

I give a few "Hard" (H) and "Unreasonable" (U) examples, showing that they can be solved in a very short time by moderately long whips.

In the Tatham examples, the name Tathamxxx, xxx is the number of countries.
In the Tatham maps, given in png format:
- I have numbered countries from 1 to xxx (North first, West first).
Colours are B Y R G:
- B  appears as dark brown
- Y appears as yellowish
- R appears as light brown / reddish
- G appears as green
