Remarks about the Slitherlink examples.

In the name of a puzzle or a directory, "H" means "Hard", "M" means "Medium", "N" means "Normal", "E" means "Easy". This classification is the original one of the corresponding website. 


<> The Tatham Slitherlink puzzles are easy in general - I would say too easy for those mentioned as "hard". The few that I have kept here are on the hardest side and do not reflect the reality of what's on the Tatham website. See in particular the H10x10 puzzle that requires a whip[7].


<> The Puzzle-loop website seems to have the most interesting diversity of puzzle levels.


<> The Kakuro-online "medium" puzzles are approximately the same difficulty as the "hard" Puzzle-loop ones. 
The main difference is, they are less slithery. As a result, they will make a lesser use of the Quasi-Loops. 
The "hard" ones are mentioned by Kakuro-online as requiring T&E (and it seems they really do), while the other ones are mentioned as being solvable by patterns (which patterns is not stated; but is seems that the SlitherRules patterns are largely enough).


<> The Mebane puzzles form a small collection with varying levels of difficulty, but with most of them on the high end of the spectrum. 
I have given the solution to all the "standard" ones (16), sometimes with a short handmade final Trial-and-Error phase added to the SlitherRules partial solution (#I.3, #I.4, #I.6, #I.9, #I.11, #I.12, #I.14, #I.15), showing what was missing in SlitherRules to finish them, before I added Extended-Loops.
I have also given the solution with the T&E(W1+Loops) procedure in some of these cases (#I.3, #I.6, #I.15).
Manual players: don't miss the non-standard puzzles (with additional constraints) in the same package. (The additional constraints are not taken care of by SlitherRules.)


<> For examples of Extended-Loops, see Mebane I.4 and I.6 or Kakuro-online #246 and #252
