WARNINGS:
Most of the Magictour puzzles are exceptionally hard and they are unlikely to be solvable by normal human players. At some point in time, in the early 2000s, they were the hardest known puzzles.

They need very long chains (or whips), upto length 22 (#182, SER = 9.4), as appears in one of them. Remember that 99,9% of the randomly generated minimal puzzles need only whips of length no more than 7.

Before trying to solve these puzzles with SudoRules, I checked whether they were solvable by braids, using my equivalence theorem with T&E = T&E(BRT). 
If they were, I tried to solve them with whips as far as possible. When whips were not enough, I solved them with braids; there are only two such cases: #89 and #187.
Only 3 of these 1469 puzzles are not in T&E and cannot be solved by braids (# 2, SER 9.5 - #3, SER 9.6 - #77, SER 9.8), but they are in gT&E = T&E(W1) and they can be solved by g-braids.

In almost all the solutions, I have activated all the rules that are special cases of whips, including Typed-chains, in order to show how they appear in the resolution paths. Notice that this has a cost in terms of resolution time. I've also selected the speed option for chain rules and all the blocked rules options.


My main reason for putting a few puzzles from this collection in the examples (in particular #2 and #3) is to show the limits of SudoRules.
They may also be very good stress test cases for CLIPS.
