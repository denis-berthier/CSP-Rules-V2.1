This is a package root directory $PACKAGEROOT. Source and binary
packages in this directory tree are controlled by the command

	bin/package

Binary files may be in this directory or in the install root directory

	INSTALLROOT=$PACKAGEROOT/arch/`bin/package`

For more information run

	bin/package help

Many of the packaged commands self-document via the --man and --html
options; those that do have no separate man page.

Each package is covered by one of the license files

	lib/package/LICENSES/<license>

where <license> is the license type for the package.  At the top
of each license file is a URL; the license covers all software that
refers to this URL. For details run

	bin/package license [<package>]

Any archives, distributions or packages made from source or
binaries covered by license(s) must contain the corresponding
license file(s).
